/** fancy feature: when data size is small,
 *  but processing time is long, then it
 *  is worth copying the packet to a local
 *  buffer, submit the next read request,
 *  and only then continue with processing
 *  the packet; this is also the reason for
 *  having the initial data request submitted
 *  separately.  if you are not interested in
 *  this feature, then simply replace the local
 *  packet buffer with a normal counter variable.

/** checking for abort requests
 *  zw_query_event is one of the fastest system calls
 *  on NT, yet the following call could be avoided altogether,
 *  for instance by using a global variable. such a variable,
 *  however, would not only introduce unnecessary complexity,
 *  but also make the function dependent on an element that
 *  lies outside of its msg structure. my ultimate
 *  recommendation: keep the call, and keep it simple.
